       " 'you may\\nhave noticed him; a stiffly erect, distinguished-looking man, with gray\\nhair, an imperial of the fashion of louis napoleon, fierce blue eyes,\\nand across his forehead a sabre cut.',\n",
       " 'this is henry ronald douglas maciver, for some time in india an ensign\\nin the sepoy mutiny; in italy, lieutenant under garibaldi; in spain,\\ncaptain under don carlos; in our civil war, major in the confederate\\narmy; in mexico, lieutenant-colonel under the emperor maximilian;\\ncolonel under napoleon iii, inspector of cavalry for the khedive of\\negypt, and chief of cavalry and general of brigade of the army of king\\nmilan of servia.',\n",
       " 'these are only a few of his military titles.',\n",
       " 'in 1884\\nwas published a book giving the story of his life up to that year.',\n",
       " 'it\\nwas called “under fourteen flags.” if to-day general maciver were to\\nreprint the book, it would be called “under eighteen flags.”\\n\\nmaciver was born on christmas day, 1841, at sea, a league off the shore\\nof virginia.',\n",
       " 'his mother was miss anna douglas of that state; ronald\\nmaciver, his father, was a scot, a rossshire gentleman, a younger son of\\nthe chief of the clan maciver.',\n",
       " 'until he was ten years old young maciver\\nplayed in virginia at the home of his father.',\n",
       " 'then, in order that he\\nmight be educated, he was shipped to edinburgh to an uncle, general\\ndonald graham.',\n",
       " 'after five years his uncle obtained for him a commission\\nas ensign in the honorable east india company, and at sixteen, when\\nother boys are preparing for college, maciver was in the indian mutiny,\\nfighting, not for a flag, nor a country, but as one fights a wild\\nanimal, for his life.',\n",
       " 'he was wounded in the arm, and, with a sword, cut\\nover the head.',\n",
       " 'as a safeguard against the sun the boy had placed inside\\nhis helmet a wet towel.',\n",
       " 'this saved him to fight another day, but even\\nwith that protection the sword sank through the helmet, the towel, and\\ninto the skull.',\n",
       " 'to-day you can see the scar.',\n",
       " 'he was left in the road\\nfor dead, and even after his wounds had healed, was six weeks in the\\nhospital.',\n",
       " 'this tough handling at the very start might have satisfied some men, but\\nin the very next war maciver was a volunteer and wore the red shirt of\\ngaribaldi.',\n",
       " 'he remained at the front throughout that campaign, and until\\nwithin a few years there has been no campaign of consequence in which he\\nhas not taken part.',\n",
       " 'he served in the ten years’ war in cuba, in\\nbrazil, in argentina, in crete, in greece, twice in spain in carlist\\nrevolutions, in bosnia, and for four years in our civil war under\\ngenerals jackson and stuart around richmond.',\n",
       " 'in this great war he was\\nfour times wounded.',\n",
       " 'it was after the surrender of the confederate army, that, with other\\nsouthern officers, he served under maximilian in mexico; in egypt, and\\nin france.',\n",
       " 'whenever in any part of the world there was fighting, or the\\nrumor of fighting, the procedure of the general invariably was the\\nsame.',\n",
       " 'he would order himself to instantly depart for the front, and on\\narriving there would offer to organize a foreign legion.',\n",
       " 'the command of\\nthis organization always was given to him.',\n",
       " 'but the foreign legion was\\nmerely the entering wedge.',\n",
       " 'he would soon show that he was fitted for\\na better command than a band of undisciplined volunteers, and would\\nreceive a commission in the regular army.',\n",
       " 'in almost every command in\\nwhich he served that is the manner in which promotion came.',\n",
       " 'sometimes he\\nsaw but little fighting, sometimes he should have died several deaths,\\neach of a nature more unpleasant than the others.',\n",
       " 'for in war the obvious\\ndanger of a bullet is but a three hundred to one shot, while in the pack\\nagainst the combatant the jokers are innumerable.',\n",
       " 'and in the career of\\nthe general the unforeseen adventures are the most interesting.',\n",
       " 'a man\\nwho in eighteen campaigns has played his part would seem to have\\nearned exemption from any other risks, but often it was outside the\\nbattle-field that maciver encountered the greatest danger.',\n",
       " 'he fought\\nseveral duels, in two of which he killed his adversary; several attempts\\nwere made to assassinate him, and while on his way to mexico he was\\ncaptured by hostile indians.',\n",
       " 'on returning from an expedition in cuba he\\nwas cast adrift in an open boat and for days was without food.',\n",
       " 'long before i met general maciver i had read his book and had heard of\\nhim from many men who had met him in many different lands while\\nengaged in as many different undertakings.',\n",
       " 'several of the older war\\ncorrespondents knew him intimately; bennett burleigh of the _telegraph_\\nwas his friend, and e. f. knight of the _times_ was one of those who\\nvolunteered for a filibustering expedition which maciver organized\\nagainst new guinea.',\n",
       " 'the late colonel ochiltree of texas told me tales\\nof maciver’s bravery, when as young men they were fellow officers in the\\nsouthern army, and stephen bonsal had met him when maciver was united\\nstates consul at denia in spain.',\n",
       " 'when maciver arrived at this post, the\\nex-consul refused to vacate the consulate, and maciver wished to settle\\nthe difficulty with duelling pistols.',\n",
       " 'as denia is a small place, the\\ninhabitants feared for their safety, and bonsal, who was our _charge\\nd’affaires_ then, was sent from madrid to adjust matters.',\n",
       " 'without\\nbloodshed he got rid of the ex-consul, and later maciver so endeared\\nhimself to the denians that they begged the state department to retain\\nhim in that place for the remainder of his life.',\n",
       " 'before general maciver was appointed to a high position at the st. louis\\nfair, i saw much of him in new york.',\n",
       " 'his room was in a side street in\\nan old-fashioned boarding-house, and overlooked his neighbor’s back yard\\nand a typical new york city sumac tree; but when the general talked one\\nforgot he was within a block of the elevated, and roamed over all\\nthe world.',\n",
       " 'on his bed he would spread out wonderful parchments, with\\nstrange, heathenish inscriptions, with great seals, with faded ribbons.',\n",
       " 'these were signed by sultans, secretaries of war, emperors, filibusters.',\n",
       " 'they were military commissions, titles of nobility, brevets for\\ndecorations, instructions and commands from superior officers.',\n",
       " 'translated the phrases ran: “imposing special confidence in,” “we\\nappoint,” or “create,” or “declare,” or “in recognition of services\\nrendered to our person,” or “country,” or “cause,” or “for bravery on\\nthe field of battle we bestow the cross----”\\n\\nas must a soldier, the general travels “light,” and all his worldly\\npossessions were crowded ready for mobilization into a small compass.',\n",
       " 'he\\nhad his sword, his field blanket, his trunk, and the tin despatch\\nboxes that held his papers.',\n",
       " 'from these, like a conjurer, he would draw\\nsouvenirs of all the world.',\n",
       " 'from the embrace of faded letters, he would\\nunfold old photographs, daguerrotypes, and miniatures of fair women and\\nadventurous men: women who now are queens in exile, men who, lifted on\\nwaves of absinthe, still, across a _cafe_ table, tell how they will win\\nback a crown.',\n",
       " 'once in a written document the general did me the honor to appoint me\\nhis literary executor, but as he is young, and as healthy as myself, it\\nnever may be my lot to perform such an unwelcome duty.',\n",
       " 'and to-day all\\none can write of him is what the world can read in “under fourteen\\nflags,” and some of the “foot-notes to history” which i have copied\\nfrom his scrap-book.',\n",
       " 'this scrap-book is a wonderful volume, but owing\\nto “political” and other reasons, for the present, of the many clippings\\nfrom newspapers it contains there are only a few i am at liberty to\\nprint.',\n",
       " 'and from them it is difficult to make a choice.',\n",
       " 'to sketch in a\\nfew thousand words a career that had developed under eighteen flags is\\nin its very wealth embarrassing.',\n",
       " 'here is one story, as told by the scrap-book, of an expedition that\\nfailed.',\n",
       " 'that it failed was due to a british cabinet minister; for had\\nlord derby possessed the imagination of the soldier of fortune, his\\nmajesty’s dominions might now be the richer by many thousands of square\\nmiles and many thousands of black subjects.',\n",
       " 'on october 29, 1883, the following appeared in the london _standard_:\\n“the new guinea exploration and colonization company is already\\nchartered, and the first expedition expects to leave before christmas.”\\n “the prospectus states settlers intending to join the first party must\\ncontribute one hundred pounds toward the company.',\n",
       " 'this subscription will\\ninclude all expenses for passage money.',\n",
       " 'six months’ provisions will be\\nprovided, together with tents and arms for protection.',\n",
       " 'each subscriber\\nof one hundred pounds is to obtain a certificate entitling him to one\\nthousand acres.”\\n\\nthe view of the colonization scheme taken by the _times_ of london, of\\nthe same date, is less complaisant.',\n",
       " '“the latest commercial sensation is\\na proposed company for the seizure of new guinea.',\n",
       " 'certain adventurous\\ngentlemen are looking out for one hundred others who have money and\\na taste for buccaneering.',\n",
       " 'when the company has been completed, its\\nshare-holders are to place themselves under military regulations, sail\\nin a body for new guinea, and without asking anybody’s leave, seize\\nupon the island and at once, in some unspecified way, proceed to realize\\nlarge profits.',\n",
       " 'if the idea does not suggest comparisons with the large\\ndesigns of sir francis drake, it is at least not unworthy of captain\\nkidd.”\\n\\nwhen we remember the manner in which some of the colonies of great\\nbritain were acquired, the _times_ seems almost squeamish.',\n",
       " 'in a melbourne paper, june, 1884, is the following paragraph:\\n\\n“toward the latter part of 1883 the government of queensland planted the\\nflag of great britain on the shores of new guinea.',\n",
       " 'when the news reached\\nengland it created a sensation.',\n",
       " 'the earl of derby, secretary for the\\ncolonies, refused, however, to sanction the annexation of new\\nguinea, and in so doing acted contrary to the sincere wish of every\\nright-thinking anglo-saxon under the southern cross.',\n",
       " '“while the subsequent correspondence between the home and queensland\\ngovernments was going on, brigadier-general h. r. maciver originated and\\norganized the new guinea exploration and colonization company in london,\\nwith a view to establishing settlements on the island.',\n",
       " 'the company,\\npresided over by general beresford of the british army, and having\\nan eminently representative and influential board of directors, had a\\ncapital of two hundred and fifty thousand pounds, and placed the\\nsupreme command of the expedition in the hands of general maciver.',\n",
       " 'notwithstanding the character of the gentlemen composing the board of\\ndirectors, and the truly peaceful nature of the expedition, his lordship\\ninformed general maciver that in the event of the latter’s attempting to\\nland on new guinea, instructions would be sent to the officer in command\\nof her majesty’s fleet in the western pacific to fire upon the company’s\\nvessel.',\n",
       " 'this meant that the expedition would be dealt with as a\\nfilibustering one.”\\n\\nin _judy_, september 21, 1887, appears:\\n\\n“we all recollect the treatment received by brigadier-general maci.',\n",
       " 'in\\nthe action he took with respect to the annexation of new guinea.',\n",
       " 'the\\ngeneral, who is a sort of pizarro, with a dash of d’artagnan, was\\ntreated in a most scurvy manner by lord derby.',\n",
       " 'had maciver not been\\nthwarted in his enterprise, the whole of new guinea would now have been\\nunder the british flag, and we should not be cheek-by-jowl with the\\ngermans, as we are in too many places.”\\n\\n_society_, september 3, 1887, says:\\n\\n“the new guinea expedition proved abortive, owing to the blundering\\nshortsightedness of the then government, for which lord derby was\\nchiefly responsible, but what little foothold we possess in new guinea,\\nis certainly due to general maciver’s gallant effort.”\\n\\ncopy of statement made by j. rintoul mitchell, june 2, 1887:\\n\\n“about the latter end of the year 1883, when i was editor-in-chief of\\nthe _englishman_ in calcutta, i was told by captain de deaux, assistant\\nsecretary in the foreign office of the indian government, that he\\nhad received a telegram from lord derby to the effect that if general\\nmaciver ventured to land upon the coast of new guinea it would become\\nthe duty of lord ripon, viceroy, to use the naval forces at his command\\nfor the purpose of deporting general maci.',\n",
       " 'sir aucland calvin can\\ncertify to this, as it was discussed in the viceregal council.”\\n\\njust after our civil war maciver was interested in another expedition\\nwhich also failed.',\n",
       " 'its members called themselves the knights of arabia,\\nand their object was to colonize an island much nearer to our shores\\nthan new guinea.',\n",
       " 'maciver, saying that his oath prevented, would never\\ntell me which island this was, but the reader can choose from\\namong cuba, haiti, and the hawaiian group.',\n",
       " 'to have taken cuba, the\\n“colonizers” would have had to fight not only spain, but the cubans\\nthemselves, on whose side they were soon fighting in the ten years’ war;\\nso cuba may be eliminated.',\n",
       " 'and as the expedition was to sail from the\\natlantic side, and not from san francisco, the island would appear to be\\nthe black republic.',\n",
       " 'from the records of the times it would seem that the\\ngreater number of the knights of arabia were veterans of the confederate\\narmy, and there is no question but that they intended to subjugate the\\nblacks of haiti and form a republic for white men in which slavery would\\nbe recognized.',\n",
       " 'as one of the leaders of this filibustering expedition,\\nmaciver was arrested by general phil sheridan and for a short time cast\\ninto jail.',\n",
       " 'this chafed the general’s spirit, but he argued philosophically that\\nimprisonment for filibustering, while irksome, brought with it\\nno reproach.',\n",
       " 'and, indeed, sometimes the only difference between a\\nfilibuster and a government lies in the fact that the government fights\\nthe gun-boats of only the enemy while a filibuster must dodge the boats\\nof the enemy and those of his own countrymen.',\n",
       " 'when the united states\\nwent to war with spain there were many men in jail as filibusters, for\\ndoing that which at the time the country secretly approved, and later\\nimitated.',\n",
       " 'and because they attempted exactly the same thing for which\\ndr. jameson was imprisoned in holloway jail, two hundred thousand of his\\ncountrymen are now wearing medals.',\n",
       " 'the by-laws of the knights of arabia leave but little doubt as to its\\nobject.',\n",
       " 'by-law no.',\n",
       " 'ii reads:\\n\\n“we, as knights of arabia, pledge ourselves to aid, comfort, and protect\\nall knights of arabia, especially those who are wounded in obtaining our\\ngrand object.',\n",
       " '“iii--great care must be taken that no unbeliever or outsider shall gain\\nany insight into the mysteries or secrets of the order.',\n",
       " '“iv--the candidate will have to pay one hundred dollars cash to\\nthe captain of the company, and the candidate will receive from the\\nsecretary a knight of arabia bond for one hundred dollars in gold, with\\nten per cent interest, payable ninety days after the recognition of (the\\nrepublic of----) by the united states, or any government.',\n",
       " '“v--all knights of arabia will be entitled to one hundred acres of\\nland, location of said land to be drawn for by lottery.',\n",
       " 'the products are\\ncoffee, sugar, tobacco, and cotton.”\\n\\na local correspondent of the new york _herald_ writes of the arrest of\\nmaciver as follows:\\n\\n“when maciver will be tried is at present unknown, as his case has\\nassumed a complicated aspect.',\n",
       " 'he claims british protection as a subject\\nof her british majesty, and the english consul has forwarded a statement\\nof his case to sir frederick bruce at washington, accompanied by a copy\\nof the by-laws.',\n",
       " 'general sheridan also has forwarded a statement to\\nthe secretary of war, accompanied not only by the by-laws, but very\\nimportant documents, including letters from jefferson davis, benjamin,\\nthe secretary of state of the confederate states, and other personages\\nprominent in the rebellion, showing that maciver enjoyed the highest\\nconfidence of the confederacy.”\\n\\nas to the last statement, an open letter i found in his scrap-book is an\\nexcellent proof.',\n",
       " 'it is as follows: “to officers and members of all camps\\nof united confederate veterans: it affords me the greatest pleasure to\\nsay that the bearer of this letter, general henry ronald maciver, was an\\nofficer of great gallantry in the confederate army, serving on the staff\\nat various times of general stonewall jackson, j. e. b. stuart, and e.\\nkirby smith, and that his official record is one of which any man may be\\nproud.',\n",
       " '“respectfully, marcus j. wright, “_agent for the collection of\\nconfederate records_.',\n",
       " '“war records office, war department, washington, july 8, 1895.”\\n\\nat the close of the war duels between officers of the two armies were\\nnot infrequent.',\n",
       " 'in the scrap-book there is the account of one of these\\naffairs sent from vicksburg to a northern paper by a correspondent who\\nwas an eye-witness of the event.',\n",
       " 'it tells how major maciver, accompanied\\nby major gillespie, met, just outside of vicksburg, captain tomlin of\\nvermont, of the united states artillery volunteers.',\n",
       " 'the duel was with\\nswords.',\n",
       " 'maciver ran tomlin through the body.',\n",
       " 'the correspondent writes:\\n\\n“the confederate officer wiped his sword on his handkerchief.',\n",
       " 'in a few\\nseconds captain tomlin expired.',\n",
       " 'one of major maciver’s seconds called to\\nhim: ‘he is dead; you must go.',\n",
       " 'these gentlemen will look after the body\\nof their friend.’ a negro boy brought up the horses, but before mounting\\nmaciver said to captain tomlin’s seconds: ‘my friends are in haste for\\nme to go.',\n",
       " 'is there anything i can do?',\n",
       " 'i hope you consider that this\\nmatter has been settled honorably?’\\n\\n“there being no reply, the confederates rode away.”\\n\\nin a newspaper of to-day so matter-of-fact an acceptance of an event so\\ntragic would make strange reading.',\n",
       " 'from the south maciver crossed through texas to join the royalist army\\nunder the emperor maximilian.',\n",
       " 'it was while making his way, with other\\nconfederate officers, from galveston to el paso, that maciver was\\ncaptured by the indians.',\n",
       " 'he was not ill-treated by them, but for three\\nmonths was a prisoner, until one night, the indians having camped near\\nthe rio grande, he escaped into mexico.',\n",
